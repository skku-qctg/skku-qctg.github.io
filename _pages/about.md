The **SKKU Quantum Computing Theory Group** focuses on theoretical research in quantum information and computation, particularly on developing resource-efficient and fault-tolerant quantum computing strategies through **quantum error correction (QEC)**.

## Research Topics

Our main research areas include:

- **QEC Code & Circuit Design**: Developing and optimizing quantum error-correcting codes and their circuit implementations
- **Decoding Algorithms**: Creating efficient algorithms to decode syndrome information and correct errors
- **Non-Clifford Gate Implementation**: Designing resource-efficient methods for implementing non-Clifford gates (e.g., magic state distillation)
- **Photonic QEC**: Exploring fault-tolerant quantum computing using photonic qubits

## Join Us

We are looking for motivated graduate students to join our group. If you are interested in quantum error correction and fault-tolerant quantum computing, please contact us at [seokhyunglee@skku.edu](mailto:seokhyunglee@skku.edu).
